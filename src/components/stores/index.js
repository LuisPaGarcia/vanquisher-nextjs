// We have some new faces here, eh? 90% of the code is quite familiar, let's examine items [A], [B], [C].

// [A]: We're using the new React Hooks API here, called useReducer. If youâ€™re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.
// It will return the state object and a dispatch function to send updates to the store state.We're creating a value object with both
// and we'll send it to our item[B].

// [B]: Here, we're using our context provider to inject the value object, making it available to all consumers. Previously we saw that
// we're using it to wrap our <App /> in ./src/index.js, meaning, all children components from <App /> would be able to pull out this context to use.

// [C]: At first look, this export is odd.We're exporting the default context object created by React, ContextOne, our custom provider,
// ContextOneProvider and an alias to the consumer key, ContextOneConsumer.To use the new Reactk Hooks API for context, called useContext,
// we need to pass the default object created by React, our first export.The second export, ContextOneProvider, is our custom provider,
// where we need to use it to inject what we want in our app context.The last export, ContextOneConsumer, is just a convenience to
// subscribe to context changes, this is a stable feature from React.
